> **1Introduction**
>
> In robotics, gait planning relies heavily on the knowledge whether

> replacing hardware with a software algorithm.
>
> When a pedestrian walks, its foot accelerates in a repetitive,
> periodic pattern. This project assumes that each part of the period
> indicates a different phase of the walk, i.e., lift foot, swing foot,
> step etc. Using recorded and labelled data from a pedestrian walk,
> this project aims to predict whether or not a step occurs - using IMU
> (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements only.

> By looking at the future contribution of this project (in another

> **2.3** **Data processing**
>
> The data processing is a crucial stage before even beginning to plan
> the NN architecture and hyperparameters. This stage allows the
> designer to get a good intuition on the way the data behaves.
> Furthermore, the preprocessing allows "helping" the neural network to
> be able to learn the data, as the designer should simplify the data
> before learning process.
>
> **2.3.1Synchronization**
>
> The collected data was labelled by index corresponding to the last
> sensor turned on. This sensor was found by taking the latest time in
> the first value of the "date" column. In order to synchronize the
> labelled indexes to the ankle sensor, the recordings collected before
> the last sensor was turned on were erased. This was also verified with
> Prof. Mattfeld, who collected the data, in order to make sure the data
> synchronization was done perfectly -- as it is highly important and
> would affect the results directly.
>
> **2.3.2Window size selection**
>
> In order to slice the time series data into sub-series, an appropriate
> time window size was examined by slicing the data into sub series each
> one between two steps. The amount of each window size in the dataset
> is shown below:

![](vertopal_11e7f62de88942ebbd346d54ad727223/media/image11.png){width="3.4236100174978126in"
height="1.8833333333333333in"}

**Figure 2.10: window size histogram**

> From the graph above it can be seen that between two labeled steps
> there are usually around 8 samples. Therefore, the data was divided
> into two classes, one for a step (left leg) and one for a non-step.

height="1.1152777777777778in"}

**Figure 2.11: sub-series slicing**

> The window is placed in such a way that there are n samples before the
> labeled step and m samples after the step (when n and m are
> hyperparameters - at the figure below n=0, m=4).

> **2.3.3Data whitening transformation**
>
> The IMU measurements were whitened as their absolute value means less
> than their values relative to each other -- helping the NN train
> better and be able to generalize. A whitening transformation is a
> linear transformation which standardizes features by removing the mean
> and scaling to unit variance.

>
> This chapter describes the main limitations of the project.
>
> **3.1** **Sensor limitations**
>
> This section focuses on the limitations related to the sensors that
> were used to collect the data.
>
> **3.1.1Saturation**

When observing the accelerometer measurement, a high saturated value
could be seen:

![](vertopal_11e7f62de88942ebbd346d54ad727223/media/image17.png){width="5.7625in"
height="2.2388877952755903in"}

**Figure 3.1: IMU Accelerometer y Saturation**

> This saturation is also expressed as an exceptionally high bean could
> be seen at the linear accelerometer along the X and Y axes. These
> beans could possibly be associated with a sensor saturation value. In
> order to confirm it is really a saturation phenomenon, the Shimmer3
> IMU's datasheet was examined, as shown in appendix 9.1. This could
> explain the high count at that exact value. As shown in Figure 2.4 the
> Y axis is along the "up-down" direction along gravity, and the X axis
> is the footstep direction.
>
> **3.1.2Non-rigid sensor position and orientation**
>
> The sensors are placed on the person's ankle by using a strap, as
> shown in Figure 2.3. This leads to variance between different people
> that may have placed the strap and the sensors in slightly different
> ways. The use of an elastic strap to attach the sensor to the ankle
> may lead to a degree of freedom and relative motion between the sensor
> and the ankle.

14

> **3.1.3Measurement noise**
>
> As explained, the dataset is based on sensors' recordings -- which
> have internal measurement noises from many different reasons such as
> temperature, warm-up, etc. which directly affect the measured values.
> These noises lead to an uncertainty in figuring out the true
> acceleration and give rise to many challenges when using the sensed
> data. The IMU's datasheet is shown in appendix 9.1.
>
> **3.1.4Low sampling frequency**

The sensors' recorded frequency is 15\[𝐻𝑧\] which is a low frequency
compared to the

system's dynamics, as there is a step at 2\[𝐻𝑧\] (around a step per leg
per second). This

> gives rise to a major challenge of slicing the data into more than 2
> classes, for example dividing the data into left step, right step and
> no step - as there will be overlapping windows that are labeled
> differently.
>
> **3.2** **Labelling**
>
> This section discusses the labelling limitations.
>
> **3.2.1Manual discrete labelling**
>
> The steps were detected by a pre-developed tool that allowed a person
> viewing a recorded video, to tag a specific moment a step occurred
> (right or left) -- from the recorded data. Labelling by hand in such a
> way might lead to a variety of errors: timing errors, accuracy errors,
> frequency limitations and more. Moreover, a step is not a
> deterministic value, and thus two different people could tag a step at
> two slightly different times.
>
> **3.2.2Labelling visually**
>
> The labelling tool described above forced the person labeling to
> visually inspect a recorded video and conclude whether or not a step
> occurred at every recorded moment.
>
> This method is highly sensitive to errors, for example:
>
> 1.The video was shot from a specific angle which might have limited
> his/her point of view.
>
> 2.The visual labeling is limited to the camera's resolution and has no
> strict conditions that determine a step.

15

> **4Network**
>
> As the dataset is a timeseries, we chose to compare two leading
> options:
>
> 1.RNNs -- GRU: these types of networks hold a hidden layer that allows
> the network to treat the data as a time series and "weight" the
> dependency of timestep on another.
>
> 2.CNNs: A network that is usually used to analyze images but is also
> used in the field of time series analysis -- by spanning the time
> measurement along a specific dimension, the different sensors' axes
> along another dimension and the different sensor types along the
> channels. This construction allows real time implementation due to the
> relatively short runtime of the CNNs.
>
> **4.1** **CNN1D**
>
> This chapter discusses the first proposed architecture -- CNN1D.
>
> **4.1.1General**
>
> One dimensional convolutional neural network is very similar to a
> fully connected layer, but with the difference that each output is the
> weighted sum of a few (size) input values thar are close (dilation) to
> each other. The innovation in this method is that the weights are kept
> constant when "sliding" along each input and are being updated along
> the backpropagation. An illustration for the different parameters of
> the 1d CNN is shown below:

![](vertopal_11e7f62de88942ebbd346d54ad727223/media/image18.png){width="4.166666666666667in"

> **4.1.2Method**

> In order to allow the network to "sense" the step through the change
> in the sensors' measurement along time, the input data was organized
> in the following manner:

**Figure 4.4: GRU illustration \[3\]**

> To solve the problem described above, GRUs use update gate and reset
> gate. Basically, these are two vectors which decide what information

> while removing information which is irrelevant to the task.
>
> **4.2.2Method**
>
> GRUs store and filter the information using its gating mechanism. It
> can be useful to insert a segment of a time sequence and analyze its
> encapsulated information by enlarging its output dimension (i.e.
> features), enabling us to spot some non-trivial correlations among the
> given features. The output of the GRU layer is a stationary vector of
> the given time sequence input (we take the last hidden state as an
> output), so we can consider it as a representative summation of the
> input, then we feed forward a quite simple fully connected layers,
> ending up with a reliable candidate of the input true classification.

> **5Benchmark**
>
> This work is evaluated compared to Basil Lin's thesis \[4\] which also
> used the Pedometer dataset \[1\] together with a CNN to predict the
> step counts in a selected window. Lin's work aims to solve a different
> problem than this project, but we found it to be the best benchmark to
> evaluate our work.
>
> The author used a CNN with a sliding window of data in order to
> predict the number of steps in each window -- allowing step counting
> by using the trained NN to count steps in a flow of new IMU data. The
> data was shaped in such a way that each sensor is represented as a
> channel, and the width of the image is occupied by the timeseries in
> the length of the sliding window. The work examined a few gait types,
> considered many different window sizes and 3 different sensor
> locations: ankle, hip, and wrist.
>
> The resulted accuracy of evaluating the number of steps in a given
> section was concluded with 98% (30,897 steps were counted out of
> 31,528 actual steps) in the regular walk. It is important to note that
> these results are different than our expected results -- as our
> mission is to detect whether a step occurred, rather than counting the

> **8Conclusion**
>
> This work aimed to solve the step detection problem. This task was
> addressed by training two different types of neural networks -- CNN
> and GRU, to sense whether or not a step occurred, by analyzing a given
> IMU timeseries data. In is important to denote that the work has led
> us to research and ask ourselves some interesting (and even
> philosophical) questions such as: What is a step? When does it start
> or end? What is defined as "not step"? and many more question. As part
> of that research, we had the chance to meet some interesting people,
> such as Prof. Mattfeld, that advised us and helped us figure our way
> through our problem.
>
> The use of recorded data from an actual IMU, instead of tackling the
> problem with simulated data, had raised many challenges -- as the
> recorded data inherently includes many different types of errors --
> that has been vastly discussed throughout this report. Although
> challenging, by constructing a suitable architecture and by tuning the
> hyperparameters -- high detection accuracy was achieved and
> practically enabled a trusted step detector.
>
> The main results are that both the CNN1D and GRU neural networks are
> suitable to tackle a noised time series data, and by tuning them in
> the right manner -- could result with a reliable step detector. It was
> interesting to note that the received accuracies were similar to both
> architectures, which are designed in a very different manner. It was
> also clear that as expected - the mission of step detection from a
> multi-people dataset was a more difficult challenge compared to a
> single person dataset. Together with that, it was found that there is
> a "general" walking pattern that characterizes many different people
> and thus a step detection from an IMU reading is a suitable task for a
> NN.
>
> This work could (and should) be further investigated in many different
> ways, for example: step detection by using another sensor location
> (for example wrist), construct and train a network that could identify
> between steps of different legs and identify if no step occurred,
> train the NN on different type of walks, train the step detector on a
> 4 legged robots, input the NN only some measurement and many more.
